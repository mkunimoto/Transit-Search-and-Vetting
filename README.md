# Transit-Search-and-Vetting

Transiting exoplanet search and vetting pipeline described in Kunimoto et al. (2019), written for use on light curve data from the original Kepler mission to find multi-planet systems.

Utilizes the Kepler Transit Model Codebase (https://github.com/jasonfrowe/Kepler; Rowe, J. 2016, Zenodo. http://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.60297) and Model-Shift (https://github.com/JeffLCoughlin/Model-Shift; Coughlin, J. L. 2017, KSCI-19105-002).
